# Day 1 Challenge: Simple Data Types

Welcome to the Day 1 Challenge! This challenge is designed to help you understand and practice working with basic data types in programming, such as integers, doubles (floating-point numbers), and strings.

## Problem Description

In this challenge, you are required to complete the given code by performing the following tasks:

1. **Declare Variables**:
   - One integer.
   - One double.
   - One string.

2. **Read Input**:
   - You will read three lines of input:
     - The first line contains an integer.
     - The second line contains a double.
     - The third line contains a string.

3. **Perform Operations**:
   - **Addition**:
     - Add the integer you read from the input to an existing integer variable and print the result.
     - Add the double you read from the input to an existing double variable and print the result, ensuring it is formatted to one decimal place.
   - **Concatenation**:
     - Concatenate an existing string with the string you read from the input and print the result.

### Input Format

1. The first line of input contains an integer.
2. The second line of input contains a double.
3. The third line of input contains a string.

### Output Format

1. Print the sum of the two integers on the first line.
2. Print the sum of the two doubles on the second line, formatted to one decimal place.
3. Print the concatenated string on the third line.

### Steps to Solve the Challenge

1. **Declare Variables**:
   - You need to declare three variables: an integer, a double, and a string.

2. **Read Input**:
   - Read the input values for the integer, double, and string from standard input (stdin).

3. **Perform Operations and Print Results**:
   - **For Integers**:
     - Add the input integer to the existing integer variable and print the result.
   - **For Doubles**:
     - Add the input double to the existing double variable and print the result, formatted to one decimal place.
   - **For Strings**:
     - Concatenate the existing string with the input string and print the result.
