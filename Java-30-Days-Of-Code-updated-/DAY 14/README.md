# Maximum Difference Calculator

This Java project calculates the maximum absolute difference between any two integers in a set of positive integers. It demonstrates the use of classes, constructors, and methods in Java to solve a specific problem related to scope and array manipulation.

## Problem Statement

The task is to find the maximum absolute difference between any two integers in a given array of positive integers.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in the `Difference` class, which includes:
- A constructor to initialize the array of integers.
- A method `computeDifference` to compute the maximum absolute difference.

## Usage

The `Solution` class reads input from the user, initializes the `Difference` class, and prints the result.

### Example

#### Input
3
-> 1 
-> 2 
-> 5

#### Output
4
