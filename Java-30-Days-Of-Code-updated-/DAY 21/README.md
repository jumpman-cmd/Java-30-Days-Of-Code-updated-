# Generic Array Printer

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates the use of generics to print elements of different types of arrays. The `printArray` method is a generic function that prints each element of its generic array parameter on a new line.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to illustrate the use of generics in Java. The `printArray` function is capable of printing arrays of any type, thereby eliminating the need for overloaded functions for different data types.

## Task

Write a single generic function named `printArray` that takes an array of generic elements as a parameter and prints each element of the array on a new line.

## Input Format

The program reads different types of arrays from standard input.

## Constraints

- You must have exactly one function named `printArray`.

## Output Format

The `printArray` function prints each element of its generic array parameter on a new line.
