# Day 7: Arrays

## Objective
Learn about the Array data structure and how to manipulate array elements.

## Task
Given an array of integers, print the elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

### Example

#### Input
4
1 4 3 2

#### Outpu
2 3 4 1

### Explanation
- The input array is `[1, 4, 3, 2]`.
- When printed in reverse order, the output is `2 3 4 1`.

## Input Format
- The first line contains an integer, `n` (the size of the array).
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers that describe the array's elements.

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 10000`, where `arr[i]` is the `i`th integer in the array.

## Output Format
Print the elements of the array in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## Solution

The solution involves:
1. Reading the size of the array.
2. Reading the array elements.
3. Printing the elements in reverse order.
