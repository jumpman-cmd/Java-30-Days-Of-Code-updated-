# Recursive Factorial Calculation

## Problem Description

This repository contains the solution to the problem of calculating the factorial of a given integer using recursion. The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

### Function Description

The `factorial` function:
- Takes an integer `n` as input.
- Returns the factorial of `n`.

### Factorial Definition

The factorial of `n` (denoted as `n!`) is defined as:
- `n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1`
- For `n = 0`, the factorial is defined as `1`.

### Example

**Input:**
3

**Output:**
6

### Explanation

The factorial of `3` is calculated as:
- `3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6`
