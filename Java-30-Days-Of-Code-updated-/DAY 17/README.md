# Calculator Power Function

## Objective

This project is part of the 30 Days of Code challenge, specifically for Day 17. The goal is to create a `Calculator` class that computes the power of two integers and handles exceptions for negative inputs.

## Task

Write a `Calculator` class with a method `int power(int n, int p)`. The `power` method takes two integers, `n` and `p`, and returns the result of `n^p`. If either `n` or `p` is negative, the method throws an exception with the message: "n and p should be non-negative".

### Input Format

Input is handled for you by the locked stub code in the editor. The first line contains an integer, `T`, the number of test cases. Each of the subsequent `T` lines contains two space-separated integers that denote `n` and `p`, respectively.

### Constraints

- No test case will result in overflow for correctly written code.

### Output Format

Output is handled for you by the locked stub code in the editor. For each test case, the output is either the result of `n^p` or the exception message if an exception is thrown.
